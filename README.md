Feedback:
1. Created Git repo, as the results should be there, and to show development sequence.
2. Started project implementation. Added all libs.
3. Forgot to add .idea to .gitignore. Removed that folder.
4. Implemented "home page". No issues.
5. Decide to choose first "public API" from google search (DummyJSON). 
6. Add "Summary page" and API for it. No issues.
7. I found that there are not enough functionality in chosen API for "real-time" data, so I started to look for another one. I decided to take weather API as it was first mentioned in technical task.
8. Waste a bit of time to found appropriate weather API, as all free APIs are very limited. Rewrote to new API
9. Add Sort and Filtration. Waste a bit of time to debug re-rendering styled components problem.
10. Add errors handling. No issues.
11. Add more styles and responsiveness. No issues.
12. Wrote the instructions on how to run the app locally.
